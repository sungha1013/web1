    <p>Kaleidoscopes:   breaking down and structuring the object typography
    The coloured scraps in the kaleidoscopes make different patterns as they move. Typography also creates a variety of shapes by arranging alphabets such as ㄱ,ㄴ,ㄷ or a,b,c. Typographic combination can invent various forms such as elements of dots, lines, and surfaces becoming geometries, toy blocks becoming structures, and zero to nine becoming all existing numbers. The ‘Kaleidoscopes’ searches for typography involving objects such as figures, materials, animals, plants, sounds, and movements, rather than just letters.</p>
    <p>Polyhedrons:   letters that borrow the shapes of objects
    The exhibition displays the various expressions of letters, such as water-drops, mist, and glossiness. It observes the process of letters transforming into concrete objects and the outcomes of the transformation. It also introduces various letters that reflect the forms, dimensions, status, structure, and properties of objects.</p>
