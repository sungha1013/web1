  <p style="margin-top:47px;"><a href="http://typojanchi.org/2019/">‘Typojanchi 2019</a>, Typography and Objects’ is about some ways of gathering letters and objects.
  This is about typography which involves objects, letters that adopt the forms of objects, one object and typography, diverse stories on objects and typography, the object which is related to typography, and the common point between objects and typography endlessly circulates without a start or end.
  Most letters create numerous words by combining some symbols. The same principle applies to typography, which requires letters as the main material. Typography is an action to create a rule by dividing, sorting, combining, and composing. What is the principle of the object? As the principle of the universe, human culture and history have been in the process of finding rules from chaos. Most of the objects in our culture were created by the rules of the combination according to the human mind and the cosmic law resonating with each other. The Concrete, such as architecture and machinery, and the Abstract, like mathematics and music, are all created according to the rules of the combination.</p>
